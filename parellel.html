                The Eiffel Tower (/ˈaɪfəl/ EYE-fəl;
                 French: tour Eiffel [tuʁ‿ɛfɛl] (About this soundlisten)) is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ 
                 de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company 
                 designed and built the tower.

                Locally nicknamed "La dame de fer" (French for "Iron Lady"),
                 it was constructed from 1887 to 1889 as the centerpiece of the 1889 World's Fair
                  and was initially criticized by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals
                   for its design, but it has become a global cultural icon of France and
                    one of the most recognizable structures in the world.[3] The Eiffel Tower is the most
                     visited monument with an entrance fee in the world; 6.91 million people ascended
                      it in 2015. The Tower was made a Monument historique in 1964 and named part of UNESCO World Heritage
                       Site ("Paris, Banks of the Seins") in 1991. [4]

            <section class="container1"> HISTORY OF EIFFEL TOWER</section>
            <p>
                The design of the Eiffel Tower is attributed to Maurice Koechlin and Émile Nouguier, 
                two senior engineers working for the Compagnie des Établissements Eiffel. 
                It was envisioned after discussion about a suitable centerpiece for the proposed 1889
                 Exposition Universelle, a world's fair to celebrate the centennial of the French Revolution.
                  Eiffel openly acknowledged that inspiration for a tower came from the Latting Observatory 
                  built in New York City in 1853.[5] In May 1884, working at home, Koechlin made a sketch of their idea, 
                  described by him as "a great pylon, consisting of four lattice girders standing apart at the base 
                  and coming together at the top, joined together by metal trusses at regular intervals".[6]
                   Eiffel initially showed little enthusiasm, but he did approve further study, and the two engineers 
                   then asked Stephen Sauvestre, the head of the company's architectural department,
                    to contribute to the design. Sauvestre added decorative arches to the base of the tower, 
                    a glass pavilion to the first level, and other embellishments.

                Work on the foundations started on 28 January 1887.[17]
                 Those for the east and south legs were straightforward, 
                 with each leg resting on four 2 m (6.6 ft) concrete slabs, one for each of the principal 
                 girders of each leg. The west and north legs, being closer to the river Seine, were more complicated:
                  each slab needed two piles installed by using compressed-air caissons 15 m (49 ft) long and 6 m (20 ft)
                   in diameter driven to a depth of 22 m (72 ft)[18] to support the concrete slabs,
                    which were 6 m (20 ft) thick. Each of these slabs supported a block of limestone with an inclined top to bear a supporting
                     shoe for the ironwork.
